    <h3 class="paragraph1">A study suggests the world's largest rainforest is losing its ability to bounce <br>back from damage caused by droughts, fires and deforestation.</h3>
    <h3 class="paragraph2">Large swathes could become sparsely forested savannah, which is much less <br>efficient than tropical forest at sucking carbon dioxide from the air.</h3>
    <h3 class="paragraph3">The giant forest traps carbon that would otherwise add to global warming.</h3>
    <h3 class="paragraph4">But previous studies have shown that parts of the Amazon are now emitting <br>more carbon dioxide than can be absorbed.</h3>
    <h3 class="paragraph5">"The trees are losing health and could be approaching a tipping point - <br>basically, a mass loss of trees," said Dr Chris Boulton of the University of <br>Exeter.</h3>
    <h3 class="link-sentence1">Record high deforestation of Amazon in January</h3>
